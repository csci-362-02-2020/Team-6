ContrastChecker.java: getConstrastRatio()
    replace "if (fgLuminosity > bgLuminosity) {" with "if (fgLuminosity < bgLuminosity) {"
    changes greater than sign to less than, the intended returned ratio is larger/smaller this changes it to smaller/larger.
    simply comment out the original line and then uncomment the fault
    
ColorConverter.java: TestRGB2Hex()
    replace result = result.substring(1, result.length()); to result = result.substring(0,result.length());
    this will not return the correct expectedOutcome because # is the notation for the beginning of a hex value. This has 
    difficulty with the compareTo() method.

DistanceCalculator.java: calculate()
    for this "fault," the code is altered to actually give the correct result as per the euclidean distance formula
    to implement this change, comment out the original return statement and uncomment the "fault"/fix
